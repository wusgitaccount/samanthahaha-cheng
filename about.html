          Samantha Cheng (she/her) works across installation, sculpture and video to seek out and devise humourous encounters in art making. In her practice these are strategies to reconsider failure as a generative space for making performative gestures that operate as an ongoing rehearsal for the real world. Based in Tāmaki Makaurau, she can often be found attempting ideas such as running into the sunset, taking holidays during 10-minute work breaks, and occasionally working on her postgraduate research.
