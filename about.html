          Samantha Cheng is an artist and writer based in Tāmaki Makaurau
          Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand. Working across installation, sculpture
          and video, she seeks out humourous encounters and pursues
          purposelessness to reconceive of failure as a generative space for
          making performative gestures that operate as an ongoing rehearsal for
          the real world. She has a Master of Visual Arts (2021) and is
          currently undergoing doctoral research at Auckland University of
          Technology.
