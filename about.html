      Samantha Cheng is an artist and writer based in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand. Working across installation, sculpture and video, she seeks out humourous encounters and pursues purposelessness to reconceive of failure as a generative space for making performative gestures that operate as an ongoing rehearsal for the real world. She has a Master of Visual Arts (2021) and is currently undergoing doctoral research at Auckland University of Technology.
