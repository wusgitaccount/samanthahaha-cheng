            <p>
              We have deliberated and procrastinated while in this space. We
              played with light sources, drawing, containers, brushes, masking,
              signage, and sixty metres of electrical extension cords. Through
              the method of play we explored spatial and material possibilities,
              working with an emphasis on process to generate futility and
              absurdity. As the things in the space were rearranged, cast aside,
              erased and brought back we basked between familiarity and
              unfamiliarity.
              <br /><br />
              Surface Level developed from a shared interest in the disregarded
              or commonplace item. Things surround us all the time, a reflection
              of a world that grapples with consumerism and abundant production.
              These things of seemingly little consequence are important in our
              lives. As we use, interact and relocate these objects, they fill
              and create space. They travel where needed and are disregarded
              when their purpose is served. They never settle, only momentarily
              inhabiting places.
