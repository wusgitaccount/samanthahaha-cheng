	   <h4> <i>Surface Level</i> (with Hugo Primbs)<br>
RM Gallery, 23 March - 16 April 2022
 </h4>
	   <p> 
We have deliberated and procrastinated while in this space. We played with light sources, drawing, containers, brushes, masking, signage, and sixty metres of electrical extension cords. Through the method of play we explored spatial and material possibilities, working with an emphasis on process to generate futility and absurdity. As the things in the space were rearranged, cast aside, erased and brought back we basked between familiarity and unfamiliarity. <br><br>
Surface Level developed from a shared interest in the disregarded or commonplace item. Things surround us all the time, a reflection of a world that grapples with consumerism and abundant production. These things of seemingly little consequence are important in our lives. As we use, interact and relocate these objects, they fill and create space. They travel where needed and are disregarded when their purpose is served. They never settle, only momentarily inhabiting places. <br><br>
This exhibition was accompanied with a text written by Theo Macdonald.
