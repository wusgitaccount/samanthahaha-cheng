          Samantha Cheng is an artist and writer based in Tāmaki Makaurau
          Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand. Working across installation, sculpture
          and video, she seeks out humourous encounters and pursues
          purposelessness to reconceive of failure as a generative space for
          making performative gestures that operate as an ongoing rehearsal for
          the real world. She has a Master of Visual Arts (2021) and is
          currently undergoing doctoral research at Auckland University of
          Technology.

                <i>Rumpus</i> presents three new commissions from Jordan Davey-Emms, Isabella Dampney and Samantha Cheng developed through their Play workshops.

                Davey-Emms led the alter-ego portrait workshop Headshot kitchen, Dampney invited participants to play the board game CA$HFLOW and Cheng asked people to make a temporary exhibition on a train from Newmarket to Mt Albert in Passengers.
                <br /><br />
                The Play workshops invited the artists to engage audiences in playful artmaking, creating collaborative or performative environments for artistic research. In these workshops play was used as a tool to enable artists and participants the freedom to try new things without the same pressure or expectations for resolved outcomes. This generated a series of workshops full of surprises, laughter, encouragement and new perspectives.
                <br /><br />
                In <i>Rumpus</i> each artist interprets and uses play in different ways as characterised in their play workshops; Davey-Emms through costuming and stage dressing, Dampney engages gameplay and storytelling and Cheng with performance highlighting the humour and failures of everyday life.
                <br /><br />
                <i>Rumpus</i> concludes a collaborative inquiry into what is playful practice, showcasing three exciting, bold and comical commissions.

                As part of Chez Derriere’s Play workshop series, <i>Passengers</i> proposed creating a temporary exhibition on a train service on the Western Line. This project invited participants to assume the role of a passenger. Passengers were to bring an artwork or item to exhibit on a short train journey from Newmarket Station to Mt Albert and back again, starting at 10am on Saturday 16 September at Newmarket Train Station.
                <br /><br />
                On arrival at Newmarket Station, all passengers were provided with a guide for the performance. During the performance event, passengers were encouraged to be creative in how they exhibited their item on the train. Items and artworks could be worn on a bag or clothing and digital media could be played on a phone or attached to a bicycle or pet. It was recommended to review AT’s train etiquette in advance.
                <br /><br />
                On return to Newmarket Station, participants stayed for a picnic of sandwiches and scones in the park at Lumsden Green, a short walk from Newmarket Train Station.
                <br /><br />
                This performance was documented. This documentation was exhibited as part of the Play exhibition <a href="rumpus.html"><i>Rumpus</i></a> at Chez Derriere on 30 September 2023.

                Mass/mess presents a collection of brooms for viewers to peruse
                onsite at Window. This exhibition is a result of the efforts of
                the artist to bring together variations of the humble broom in a
                reframing of the object into an art context. Placed in this
                installation, the objects become artefacts; they are relics of
                the spaces they used to inhabit and function in. Within the
                collection, they also come to represent the people and/or
                institutions who have generously loaned them out to the artist.
                <br /><br />
                Together, the individual objects create an installation that
                considers the broom’s materiality and thing-power. The brooms
                are in order and then out of order. Some have been interfered
                with through visible ‘improvements’ and others have been
                dismantled into the parts that make it whole.
