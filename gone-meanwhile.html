	   <h4> <i>Gone meanwhile back soon </i>(Master of Visual Arts Graduating Exhibition)<br>
St. Paul St Gallery, 23 - 26 June 2021 </h4>
	   <p> 
This exhibition is the conclusion of my practice-based research which examined the role of failure in art making. At the centre of this project was a series of art works that attempted to fail by: never beginning, self-censoring, pursuing purposelessness, never being ready, or devising ways to ensure irresolution. The project reconceived of failure as a generative space: a <i>meanwhile</i> that allows for self-censorship, avoiding failure, conducting only rehearsals, performative gestures, and deferring decision making. 
<br><br>
Through a series of performative gestures, the research used the notions of rehearsing and stalling to seek to challenge failure and the fear it elicits. 
<br><br>
This research is accompanied with an exegesis ‘Meanwhile, rehearsals’, which can be found at:
