	   <h2> Gone meanwhile back soon (Master of Visual Arts Graduating Exhibition)
St. Paul St Gallery, 23 - 26 June 2021 </h2>
	   <p> 
This exhibition is the conclusion of my practice-based research which examined the role of failure in art making. At the centre of this project was a series of art works that attempted to fail by: never beginning, self-censoring, pursuing purposelessness, never being ready, or devising ways to ensure irresolution. The project reconceived of failure as a generative space: a meanwhile that allows for self-censorship, avoiding failure, conducting only rehearsals, performative gestures, and deferring decision making. 

Through a series of performative gestures, the research used the notions of rehearsing and stalling to seek to challenge failure and the fear it elicits. 


This research is accompanied with an exegesis ‘Meanwhile, rehearsals’, which can be found at: https://tuwhera.aut.ac.nz/research-repository
