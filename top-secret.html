          Samantha Cheng is an artist and writer based in Tāmaki Makaurau
          Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand. Working across installation, sculpture
          and video, she seeks out humourous encounters and pursues
          purposelessness to reconceive of failure as a generative space for
          making performative gestures that operate as an ongoing rehearsal for
          the real world. She has a Master of Visual Arts (2021) and is
          currently undergoing doctoral research at Auckland University of
          Technology.

               <i>Maximum Potential NOW</i> brings together three artists: Samantha Cheng, Matt Joils and Sophie Sutherland, who each draw from the multiple, and ever-pervasive, languages and realities of consumer capitalism—what writer Jia Tolentino refers to in her essay ‘Always Be Optimizing’ as the “chopped-salad economy’s accelerationist nightmare.”
                <br /><br />
                One of these realities is the feeling of failure; felt through an acute lack, an inability to measure up to the expected standard, or how active opposition or resistance to capitalism can become, ultimately, subsumed back into the norm. Much of the language of commercial advertising exploits anxieties around failure. A language often shared by the self-help and wellness industries: are you surviving or thriving?

                <i>Rumpus</i> presents three new commissions from Jordan Davey-Emms, Isabella Dampney and Samantha Cheng developed through their Play workshops.
                <br /><br />
                Davey-Emms led the alter-ego portrait workshop Headshot kitchen, Dampney invited participants to play the board game CA$HFLOW and Cheng asked people to make a temporary exhibition on a train from Newmarket to Mt Albert in Passengers.
                <br /><br />
                The Play workshops invited the artists to engage audiences in playful artmaking, creating collaborative or performative environments for artistic research. In these workshops play was used as a tool to enable artists and participants the freedom to try new things without the same pressure or expectations for resolved outcomes. This generated a series of workshops full of surprises, laughter, encouragement and new perspectives.
                <br /><br />
                In <i>Rumpus</i> each artist interprets and uses play in different ways as characterised in their play workshops; Davey-Emms through costuming and stage dressing, Dampney engages gameplay and storytelling and Cheng with performance highlighting the humour and failures of everyday life.
                <br /><br />
                <i>Rumpus</i> concludes a collaborative inquiry into what is playful practice, showcasing three exciting, bold and comical commissions.

              <p>
                As part of Chez Derriere’s Play workshop series, <i>Passengers</i> proposed creating a temporary exhibition on a train service on the Western Line. This project invited participants to assume the role of a passenger. Passengers were to bring an artwork or item to exhibit on a short train journey from Newmarket Station to Mt Albert and back again, starting at 10am on Saturday 16 September at Newmarket Train Station.
                <br /><br />
                On arrival at Newmarket Station, all passengers were provided with a guide for the performance. During the performance event, passengers were encouraged to be creative in how they exhibited their item on the train. Items and artworks could be worn on a bag or clothing and digital media could be played on a phone or attached to a bicycle or pet. It was recommended to review AT’s train etiquette in advance.
                <br /><br />
                On return to Newmarket Station, participants stayed for a picnic of sandwiches and scones in the park at Lumsden Green, a short walk from Newmarket Train Station.
                <br /><br />
                This performance was documented. This documentation was exhibited as part of the Play exhibition <a href="rumpus.html"><i>Rumpus</i></a> at Chez Derriere on 30 September 2023.

                Mass/mess presents a collection of brooms for viewers to peruse
                onsite at Window. This exhibition is a result of the efforts of
                the artist to bring together variations of the humble broom in a
                reframing of the object into an art context. Placed in this
                installation, the objects become artefacts; they are relics of
                the spaces they used to inhabit and function in. Within the
                collection, they also come to represent the people and/or
                institutions who have generously loaned them out to the artist.
                <br /><br />
                Together, the individual objects create an installation that
                considers the broom’s materiality and thing-power. The brooms
                are in order and then out of order. Some have been interfered
                with through visible ‘improvements’ and others have been
                dismantled into the parts that make it whole.

              Interim Express is an invitation to linger in the meanwhile
              instead of desiring to be on the move or actively in progress
              towards a goal or outcome. There is greenery in the space, cups
              available for your convenience, and even a pen. We may take the
              time to notice the typo on a sign or imagine how the holes in a
              wall trace the actions of someone else. These objects and things
              have been altered, rearranged, cast aside, and repurposed through
              engagement with the space.
              <br /><br />
              Prolonged periods in the interim lead to weariness and boredom.
              Just as there are new discoveries, there are also anxieties and a
              restlessness that accompany being inactive or doing nothing for
              longer than is preferred. There is both joy and frustration to be
              encountered. As we re-visit these states of suspended time and
              space, the interim welcomes you back each time.

              <i>Take a 10</i> (March 2022) sees the artist floating on an
              inflatable at the beach in her retail work uniform. We follow the
              inflatable’s wandering path on the screen for approximately 10
              minutes, the same minimum time allotted for paid breaks to
              employees by New Zealand law. Seagulls make several appearances
              and at one point, a couple can be seen frolicking in the
              background. On occasion, the floating figure disappears just out
              of screen - but only momentarily.

              efforts to run into the sunset one evening. Usually signalling a
              true and triumphant end to a storyline for a protagonist, creating
              this finale for oneself reveals how ridiculous and futile the act
              is. With each awkward and clumsy attempt, we return to the
              question of what is really futile in the video: the act or trying?

              Ambient Television is a series of artist video screenings
              organised by Theo Macdonald with Audio Foundation. The project
              stems from a desire to see broader opportunities for video artists
              to exhibit and an awareness that not all video practices are
              suited to the (currently) dominant looping installation model.

              We have deliberated and procrastinated while in this space. We
              played with light sources, drawing, containers, brushes, masking,
              signage, and sixty metres of electrical extension cords. Through
              the method of play we explored spatial and material possibilities,
              working with an emphasis on process to generate futility and
              absurdity. As the things in the space were rearranged, cast aside,
              erased and brought back we basked between familiarity and
              unfamiliarity.
              <br /><br />
              Surface Level developed from a shared interest in the disregarded
              or commonplace item. Things surround us all the time, a reflection
              of a world that grapples with consumerism and abundant production.
              These things of seemingly little consequence are important in our
              lives. As we use, interact and relocate these objects, they fill
              and create space. They travel where needed and are disregarded
              when their purpose is served. They never settle, only momentarily
              inhabiting places.

                This exhibition is the conclusion of my practice-based research
                which examined the role of failure in art making. At the centre
                of this project was a series of art works that attempted to fail
                by: never beginning, self-censoring, pursuing purposelessness,
                never being ready, or devising ways to ensure irresolution. The
                project reconceived of failure as a generative space: a
                <i>meanwhile</i> that allows for self-censorship, avoiding
                failure, conducting only rehearsals, performative gestures, and
                deferring decision making. <br /><br />
                Through a series of performative gestures, the research used the
                notions of rehearsing and stalling to seek to challenge failure
                and the fear it elicits.
                <br /><br />
                This research is accompanied with an exegesis ‘Meanwhile,
                rehearsals’, which can be found at:
