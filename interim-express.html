        <p>Interim Express<br>
ODDLY Gallery, 19 May - 10 June 2023<br><br>
          Interim Express is an invitation to linger in the meanwhile instead of desiring to be on the move or actively in progress towards a goal or outcome. There is greenery in the space, cups available for your convenience, and even a pen. We may take the time to notice the typo on a sign or imagine how the holes in a wall trace the actions of someone else. These objects and things have been altered, rearranged, cast aside, and repurposed through engagement with the space. 
<br><br>
          Prolonged periods in the interim lead to weariness and boredom. Just as there are new discoveries, there are also anxieties and a restlessness that accompany being inactive or doing nothing for longer than is preferred. There is both joy and frustration to be encountered. As we re-visit these states of suspended time and space, the interim welcomes you back each time.
